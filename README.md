## How to use
* You can download and include `quadtree.js` in your p5 sketch or refer to it via this CDN link:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/CodingTrain/QuadTree/quadtree.js"></script>
```

Once you've include the library you can create a `QuadTree` object a `Rectangle` boundary and maximum capacity:

```javascript
const r = new Rectangle(0, 0, width, height);
const capacity = 4;
const quadtree = new QuadTree(r, capacity);
```

## Testing
To run tests use one of the following commands

For continuous testing
```
npm run test-watch
```

For a single run test, with coverage
```
npm run test
```
This will output to the `coverage` folder where you can few test coverage by opening index.html
